# Weekend EDAs

Having spent some time learning about the general field of Data Science (including but not limited to ML,
 hypothesis testing, data cleaning and extraction) I have decided to get my hands dirty 
 with some subjectively fun projects.
 
 My hands-on experience until now with data science is from assignments from my university, MOOCs
 and my current thesis in [Molecular Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics).
 Although my thesis is interesting I was getting way too specialized tasks and knowledge and felt like
 doing something more general. So I am spending some time some days (not necessarily weekends but it makes for
  a good title) on random topics that I consider that I could extract nice insights, visualizations etc.
  
  
  ## PCA on Fire Images :fire:
  
  A friend of mine is having his thesis on fire recognition on images. Also, I have used
  PCA on many tasks of dimensionality reduction or in general study about the meaning of
  eignevectors of the covariance matrix of a dataset.
      
  So combining the above I thought of using **PCA as a technique of noise reduction** on these fire images.
    
  You can download and play with the notebook. The dataset that I used is not available but **any image dataset
  can be used**.  
  **Tip:** For a greater understanding I suggest printing the `.shape` of the arrays
