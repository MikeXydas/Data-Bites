# Weekend EDAs

Having spent some time learning about the general field of Data Science (including but not limited to ML,
 hypothesis testing, data cleaning and extraction) I have decided to get my hands dirty 
 with some subjectively fun projects.
 
 My hands-on experience until now with data science is from assignments from my university, MOOCs
 and my current thesis in [Molecular Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics).
 Although my thesis is interesting I was getting way too specialized tasks and knowledge and felt like
 doing something more "global". So I am spending some time some days (not necessarily weekends but it makes for
  a good title) on random topics that I consider that I could extract nice insights, visualizations etc.
