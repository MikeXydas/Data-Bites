    "Initially, I thought of scrapping the [skytrax](vhttps://www.airlinequality.com/) website, which seemed pretty easy. Before doing that however, a quick search showed me that someone has already done that and the [data uploaded on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/efehandanisman/skytrax-airline-reviews) is fairly recent.  \n",

    "Actually, the fact that it does not include reviews of the last months may be a good thing. As I was browsing skytrax I noticed many recent negative reviews of cancellations, new no-refund policies and lockdown measures, that were caused by Covid-19. Hopefully, this does not reflect the reality of air traveling and we avoid using it in our analysis. "
